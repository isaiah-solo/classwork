Grader:  copy this file into the student's directory and grade
according to the following point values.  There are a max of 30
points for the program and 30 points for the test run.  

The numbers in parens are the max points for a particular section.
Enter some number between 0 and the max depending on the quality
of the work.

________________________________________________________________________
PROGRAM SOURCE CODE. (30)

    Run mk.build

    (3) checksource did not complain

    (3) no loops, all control via recursion

    (3) general appearance of code, indentation, meaningful idents

    (3) code to implement + and - by calling a worker function

    (3) actual absolute add function

    (3) actual absolute sub function

    (3) code to implement l and s functions, symbol table

    (3) code to implement *, /, %, ^

    (3) finished implementation in main execute

    (3) code to implement c d f p

total source code: /30
min 1, max 30.

________________________________________________________________________
TEST RUN.  (30)

If the makefile does not produce the executable scmdc as
required, create it by hand, or run it interactively from bigloo
from the assignments subdirectory.

Compare the output approximately to that produced by dc.

    Run mk.tests

    (3) If gmake above failed, deduct 3 points and build the
        binary by hand.

    Do each of the following tests produce output exactly as
    dc?  Approximately as dc?  Give full points if output is
    close or reasonable.

    (3) test0-stack

    (3) test1-addition

    (3) test2-subtract 

    (3) test3-muldivrem.in

    (3) test4-expsqrt.in

    (3) test5-underflow.in

    (3) test6-loadstore.in

    Final two checks after looking at testing:

    (3) Deduct 3 points if any diff output from dc vs ocamldc.
        But in the tests below, allow anything reasonable.

    (3) Deduct 3 points if any of the test runs caused an ocaml
        crash on an exception instead of normal completion.

total testing: /30
min 0, max 30

________________________________________________________________________

Add program + testing totals, giving:
SUBTOTAL=

If pair programming, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL - TOTAL1.
If not, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL.

TOTALSCORE=
